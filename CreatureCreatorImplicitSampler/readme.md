# Creature Creator Implicit Sampler

This is the heart of the project, a particle based implicit surface sampler which allows rendering complex moving implicit surfaces in real time.
A particle system was chosen over ray marching because it's cool.

This wouldn't be possible without two very helpful papers.


This first paper describes a fast geometric approach to taking a rough sample of an implicit surface, similar to Delauany triangle.

The second paper describes a particle system that's used to refine the rough sample into an even distribution, and keep them on the surface as it moves.
